## Apollo and graphQL Server setup learning from doc tutorial with spaceX API

As cool as this project sounds, I'm going to put it on hold, it is simply too complex for my first Apollo GraphQL app, I'm just copy pasting code without gaining too much knowledge. Even though I have worked with Redux.

This project is on hold.
